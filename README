This is gonna be like my EinsteinFieldEquationSolution, but using OpenCL
and lots of metaprogramming, which means Lua markup
which means I'm skipping the C++.

The bottleneck will be the linear solver, unless I rewrite them in OpenCL as well, which I might do.

How it works:

1) provide initial stress-energy conditions, in terms of primitives (not T_ab, because that depends on g_ab)

2) provide initial metric primitivies

3) solve the quadratic function G_ab = 8 pi T_ab, where G_ab is derived from the metric prims, and T_ab is derived from the stress-energy (and metric) prims
