Newton descent across the Einstein Field Equation constraints
solve the metric using the norm of G_ab = 8 pi T_ab
This is gonna be like my EinsteinFieldEquationSolution project, but using OpenCL
And now I'm going to do the legwork and finish the math to calculate the gradient descent directly, rather than numerically approximating it.
And I'm adding lots of metaprogramming, which means Lua markup, which is more difficult to write out in C++.
Which means I'm skipping the C++.  Hooray!

How it works:

1) provide initial stress-energy conditions, in terms of primitives (not T_ab, because that depends on g_ab)

2) provide initial metric primitivies

3) solve the quadratic function G_ab = 8 pi T_ab, where G_ab is derived from the metric prims, and T_ab is derived from the stress-energy (and metric) prims

Requires:

luajit ffi
malkia's ufo
lua-ext
lua-vec
lua-cl
my ffi bindings (which include my ffi vector classes)
template-lua
symmath-lua

For the spherical body problem it is converging slowly (1e-30) in flat space initial conditions,
but once it starts to develop surface features it converges very quickly.
I'm thinking I should use a line search to fix this.  Maybe Hessian as well, but that'd be complex, so I'll put it off until my automatic symbolic generation (which depends on me simplifying TensorRef * TensorRef in my symmath-lua)
